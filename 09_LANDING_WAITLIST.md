## Framer Draft (Private)
- URL: https://energetic-topic-311639.framer.app/
- Status: Draft publish (link-only share). Not announced publicly.

## Waitlist Capture
- Method: Google Form -> Google Sheets
- Form URL: https://forms.gle/8c7bNAw85x2hD8YD8

## Sections (Current)
- Hero (headline + subheadline + primary CTA)
- 3 bullets (value props)
- Sample cards (placeholders / wireframe images)
- Email capture CTA (links to Google Form)
- Footer (privacy note + placeholders)

## Week 4 Success Metric
Primary (Stretch):
- 100 waitlist sign-ups by Week 4 open

Base (Must-have):
- 25 waitlist sign-ups by Week 4 open (friends + communities)

Diagnostic (optional):
- Visits: 500+ landing visits (Framer analytics if available)
- Conversion: 5%+ (signups / visits)

Measurement:
- Sign-ups = Google Sheet row count
- Visits = Framer analytics (or link click estimates)

## Week 2 Marketing Strategy Update (Planned)
- From Week 2 onward, lead with daily morning email/SMS delivery (“Quiet Invite”) first, then later nudge app/PWA installation.
- Hero copy direction (KR/EN): “3-minute dopamine detox” + “the quietest place on your phone.”
