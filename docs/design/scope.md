# Design Scope (Week 1 · Day 2)

## Goal
Define a shippable MVP UI scope (5 screens) and lock what is NOT included in v1 to keep build velocity high.

---

## MVP Screens (v1)
1. **Login**
2. **Home / Feed**
3. **Content Detail**
4. **Saved / Bookmarks**
5. **Settings (minimal)**

---

## What v1 MUST support
- Email-based authentication flow (MVP-friendly)
- Browse curated content (Home)
- Read content with high focus (Detail)
- Save/unsave content (Detail + Saved)
- Minimal settings: account info + sign out

---

## Out of Scope (move to v2+)
- Social features (follow, comments, sharing feed)
- Recommendation engine UI (personalized ranking controls, explanation UI)
- User profile customization (avatar, bio, themes)
- Dark mode / theme switching (unless free via system)
- Notifications / reminders
- Search / filters (unless trivially added later)
- Admin curation console inside the app

---

## Assumptions
- Content quality and readability are the product.
- Navigation should be minimal and predictable.
- Design artifacts are meant to be “developer-ready,” not polished marketing visuals.
