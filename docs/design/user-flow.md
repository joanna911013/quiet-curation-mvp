# Core User Flows (Option B: Home → Detail)

## Why Option B
Home is for selection and context. Detail is for immersion and emotional impact.
This separation keeps the reading experience quiet and focused while keeping Home scannable.

## Flow 1 — First-time user login
1. User opens the app
2. Sees **Login**
3. Enters email
4. Taps primary CTA (e.g., “Continue with email” / “Send sign-in link”)
5. Receives sign-in link
6. Returns authenticated → lands on **Home**

Success criteria:
- User can authenticate without confusion
- Login copy reduces anxiety (no password, privacy reassurance)

## Flow 2 — Read content (main flow)
1. **Home** shows 1–3 curated cards (title + preview + source)
2. User taps a content card
3. Navigates to **Content Detail**
4. User reads (long-form / full quote / passage)
5. Optional: user saves (toggle/bookmark)

Success criteria:
- Tap-to-detail feels natural (Home is preview, Detail is reading)
- Reading is uninterrupted (no noisy UI)

---

## Flow 3 — Save and revisit
A) Save from Detail
1. User taps Save on **Detail**
2. Save state updates immediately (clear visual feedback)

B) Revisit from Saved
1. User opens **Saved**
2. Taps an item
3. Opens **Detail**

Success criteria:
- Saved list is stable and easy to scan
- One tap to return to reading

## Flow 4 — Settings (minimal)
1. User opens **Settings**
2. Sees account email
3. Can sign out
4. Optional: About / version info

Success criteria:
- Settings never competes with reading
- Sign out works and is discoverable but not prominent
