# Design Principles

## 1) Do not interrupt reading
Every UI decision should protect attention and flow.
Navigation and controls should be quiet and secondary.

## 2) Whitespace creates emotion
Spacing and line rhythm matter more than decoration.
The layout should feel calm, breathable, and intentional.

## 3) One screen, one intent
- Home: choose
- Detail: read
- Saved: return
- Settings: manage
Avoid mixing multiple “modes” in one place.

## 4) Less explanation, more resonance
Avoid over-instruction and excessive labels.
Let the text lead; UI should stay in the background.

## 5) Saving should feel like “keeping,” not “clicking”
Save interactions must be subtle, instant, and non-disruptive.
A bookmark is a quiet memory, not a call-to-action.
