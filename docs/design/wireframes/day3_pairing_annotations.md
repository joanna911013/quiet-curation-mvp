# Day 3 Pairing Wireframe Annotations

## Today (/)
Wireframe: `docs/design/wireframes/02.home.png`

A1. Add a compact pairing block below the primary Today content. The pairing block should not shift primary content position between days.
A2. Content: verse reference line + 1-2 line excerpt only; no rationale.
A3. Keep the block visually secondary (reduced contrast, tighter height).
A4. Ensure the block reads as skimmable in under 3 seconds.

## Detail (/c/[id])
Wireframe: `docs/design/wireframes/03_detail.png`

B1. Verse block appears first (full text).
B2. Add a rationale section below the verse:
    - Title: "Why this pairing?"
    - Body: 2-4 lines max (clamped at 4 lines).
    - Use spacing or a subtle divider to distinguish verse and rationale without adding visual noise.
B3. Rationale should be lighter in weight than the verse.

## Fallback (No Pairing Available)
- Omit the pairing section entirely.
- No placeholder copy or error messaging in the pairing area.
