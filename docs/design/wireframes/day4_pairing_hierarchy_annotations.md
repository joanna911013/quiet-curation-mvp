# Day 4 Pairing Hierarchy Wireframe Notes

## Today (/)
Wireframe: `docs/design/wireframes/02.home.png`

- Pairing block is compact and secondary (no banner treatment).
- Show reference line + 1-2 line verse excerpt only.
- Use subtle border, no shadow; keep height in the 80-96px range.
- No rationale or attribution in Today preview.

## Detail (/c/[id])
Wireframe: `docs/design/wireframes/03_detail.png`

- Verse block first, full text.
- Rationale section below with title "Why this pairing?" and body clamped to 4 lines.
- Attribution line follows rationale, prefixed with "— ".
- Styling stays quiet: lighter text, no callout background.

## Fallback (No Pairing)
- Omit the pairing section entirely; do not display placeholder copy.
