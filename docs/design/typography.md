# Typography & Tone

## Typography (v1)
- **Font:** System UI (default platform font)
- **Hierarchy:**
  - Title: clear, slightly larger, medium weight
  - Body: comfortable base size with generous line height
  - Source/meta: smaller and lighter
- **Line length:** prefer readable widths; avoid overly wide text blocks
- **Emphasis:** use weight (regular/bold) rather than color or decoration

Recommended defaults (can be tuned later):
- Body line height: ~1.5–1.7
- Paragraph spacing: comfortable (avoid dense blocks)

---

## Tone (microcopy)
- Quiet, warm, grounded
- Minimal but reassuring
- Avoid hype and marketing language

Examples:
- Login CTA: “Continue with email” or “Send sign-in link”
- Login subtext: “We’ll email you a one-time sign-in link. No password.”
- Privacy reassurance: “We never share your email.” (optional)
