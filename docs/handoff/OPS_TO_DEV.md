# OPS To DEV
Last updated: 2026-01-22

Handoff notes for operational requirements that impact implementation and data workflows.

## Updates
- Expanded Safe Pairing Set to 10 approved items (ops-marked) and documented in `docs/ops/day3_pairing_inventory.md`.
- Approved the 2026-01-21 pairing and inserted new approved pairings for 2026-01-27 to 2026-02-01 (public domain sources).
- Added SQL for candidate listing + bulk verification and a daily review checklist with a 3-item sample run.
- No DB flag for safe set yet; currently tracked as `safe_set? = yes (ops)` in docs only.
